## Overview ##

This is a the core module for SilverStripe 3, which extends the SiteTree and acts as the base module for a full-featured CMS that provides support for:

* Images, videos ([http://www.youtube.com/](YouTube) and [https://vimeo.com/](Vimeo)), and file uploads
* Related content
* Commenting with Disqus
* Featured content slider
* Sitemap and various other functionality

This module can be used as-is for simpler website, or our other modules which extends SilverStripe further.

## Requirements ##

Requires a SilverStripe 3 ([http://silverstripe.org](http://silverstripe.org)) installation.

## Development and Contribution ##

We'd like develop a comprehensive platform which would make web development easier and quicker. At this point, some of the functionality that's provided is written using _very_ simple code which would probably cause an error if used incorrectly. We hope to improve this as we go along, and any help with this would be greatly appreciated.
